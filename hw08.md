1).伪代码：


Read input number;

While number is not zero  

calculate  the remainder of number divided by 16;

IF remainder greater than 9

add one digit('A'~'F') to ouput number ;

ELSE

add remainder('0'~'9') to output number;

END IF

number divided 16;

END While;

print output number;

1).Top-down design 

A top-down approach (also known as stepwise design and in some cases used as a synonym of decomposition) is essentially the breaking down of a system to gain insight into its compositional sub-systems in a reverse engineering fashion. In a top-down approach an overview of the system is formulated, specifying, but not detailing, any first-level subsystems. Each subsystem is then refined in yet greater detail, sometimes in many additional subsystem levels, until the entire specification is reduced to base elements. A top-down model is often specified with the assistance of "black boxes", which makes it easier to manipulate. However, black boxes may fail to clarify elementary mechanisms or be detailed enough to realistically validate the model. Top down approach starts with the big picture. It breaks down from there into smaller segments.[1] 


2).Work breakdown structure

A work-breakdown structure (WBS)[2] in project management and systems engineering, is a deliverable-oriented breakdown of a project into smaller components. A work breakdown structure is a key project deliverable that organizes the team's work into manageable sections. The Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK 5) defines the work-breakdown structure "A hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables." 


3).
top down是先设计大框架，再完善框架各部分的细节.
wbs是把问题拆分为可解决的小问题，再逐个解决.

相同之处在于都有分步处理问题的过程,不同之处在于top down有设计初步框架的自顶而下的过程,wbs没有.
