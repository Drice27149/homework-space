1.Method of complements

In mathematics and computing, the method of complements is a technique used to subtract one number from another using only addition of positive numbers. This method was commonly used in mechanical calculators and is still used in modern computers. 

The method of complements can be extended to other number bases (radices); in particular, it is used on most digital computers to perform subtraction, represent negative numbers in base 2 or binary arithmetic and test underflow and overflow in calculation.

2.Byte

The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits, representing a binary number. Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single character of text in a computer[1][2] and for this reason it is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer architectures.

3.Integer (computer science)


In computer science, an integer is a datum of integral data type, a data type that represents some range of mathematical integers. Integral data types may be of different sizes and may or may not be allowed to contain negative values. Integers are commonly represented in a computer as a group of binary digits (bits). The size of the grouping varies so the set of integer sizes available varies between different types of computers. Computer hardware, including virtual machines, nearly always provide a way to represent a processor register or memory address as an integer. 

4.Floating point

In computing, floating-point arithmetic (FP) is arithmetic using formulaic representation of real numbers as an approximation so as to support a trade-off between range and precision. 
The term floating point refers to the fact that a number's radix point (decimal point, or, more commonly in computers, binary point) can "float"; that is, it can be placed anywhere relative to the significant digits of the number. This position is indicated as the exponent component, and thus the floating-point representation can be thought of as a kind of scientific notation.

A floating-point system can be used to represent, with a fixed number of digits, numbers of different orders of magnitude: e.g. the distance between galaxies or the diameter of an atomic nucleus can be expressed with the same unit of length. The result of this dynamic range is that the numbers that can be represented are not uniformly spaced; the difference between two consecutive representable numbers grows with the chosen scale.

1).
证明：


设X为共有k位的二进制数。


设X补=two's complement of X


设X反=X的ones' complement 

要证：二进制的负数（two's complement of X）等于X 的ones' complement  ＋1

只需证明：

X补=X反+1


由ones' complement(反码)的定义得：


X+X反=2^k+2^k-1......+2^1+2^0

=2^k-1  ①


由two's complement(补码)的定义得：

Negative (I) = 2^k–I

即：

X+X补=2^k  ②

联立①②式得

X补=X反+1

即二进制的负数（two's complement of X）等于X 的ones' complement  ＋1得证。


2).417


1).BF,BBBBBBBF  
2).计算过程：

When turning a two's-complement number with a certain number of bits into one with more bits (e.g., when copying from a 1-byte variable to a 2-byte variable), the most-significant bit must be repeated in all the extra bits.

我的理解：
把8字节(int8_t )的变量转化为32字节(int)的变量时，用most-significant的字节位置上的数(此处为符号位上的1)重复填满多出来的字节位置。

证明：

若X为正数，易得变化后X值不变。

若X为负数：

设X对应的数值的绝对值为X绝对

由Negative (I) = 2^k–I

得：

X+X绝对=2^8

同理：

y+X绝对=2^32

得出：


y=2^32-2^8+X

=(1111...1111)2(32个1)-(11111111)+X

=(111....1100000000)2+X

证毕。


1).
NaN

我的理解：
NaN不是一个数值，但当程序运算结果无意义或不明确时，返回NaN。

In computing, NaN, standing for not a number, is a numeric data type value representing an undefined or unrepresentable value, especially in floating-point calculations. Systematic use of NaNs was introduced by the IEEE 754 floating-point standard in 1985, along with the representation of other non-finite quantities like infinities.

Two separate kinds of NaNs are provided, termed quiet NaNs and signaling NaNs. Quiet NaNs are used to propagate errors resulting from invalid operations or values, whereas signaling NaNs can support advanced features such as mixing numerical and symbolic computation or other extensions to basic floating-point arithmetic. For example, 0/0 is undefined as a real number, and so represented by NaN; the square root of a negative number is imaginary, and thus not representable as a real floating-point number, and so is represented by NaN; and NaNs may be used to represent missing values in computations.
